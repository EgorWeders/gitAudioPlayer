Repo contains only body.

Copy url to file into input form (works only with github, because it adds ?raw=true inside)

To use it without downloading go to https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/EgorWeders/gitAudioPlayer/blob/main/player.html. 

Im not responsible for any troubles with htmlpreview, you can use any
